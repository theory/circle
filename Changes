0.03
      - Updated use of DBIx::Connection to to its new name: DBIx::Connector.
      - Fixed bug in the `on_error` and `on_disconnect` handlers. Channels
        were passed as a hash reference rather than an array reference.

      - Abandoned Bot::BasicBot in favor of a new implementation that supports
        a chain of callback handlers.
      - Changed database from logging "messages" to logging "events".
      - Now logging a lot more events.
      - Dumped Model::DBI; will use DBIx::Connection.
      - Lots of other stuff it's not worth going into since no one else is
        using Circle yet.
