This file documents the revision history for Perl extension App::Circle.

0.04
     - Updated for Perl 5.14.
     - Now require PostgreSQL 9.1 or higher for the CITEXT extension.
     - Removed Catalyst. Have yet to write a Web UI, and it probably won't be
       catalyst when it finally happens.
     - Fixed handling of socket errors, which were ignored thanks to a
       mis-spelling.
     - Added a warning for unhandled events (which would have helped me find
       the unhandled socket error earlier!).
     - Added a `HUP` signal handler. When the bot is `HUP`ed, it will re-read
       the configuration file and `part` and `join` channels as appropriate.
       This makes it easy to change the channels circle is on without
       restarting.

      - Updated use of DBIx::Connection to to its new name: DBIx::Connector.
      - Fixed bug in the `on_error` and `on_disconnect` handlers. Channels
        were passed as a hash reference rather than an array reference.

      - Abandoned Bot::BasicBot in favor of a new implementation that supports
        a chain of callback handlers.
      - Changed database from logging "messages" to logging "events".
      - Now logging a lot more events.
      - Dumped Model::DBI; will use DBIx::Connection.
      - Lots of other stuff it's not worth going into since no one else is
        using Circle yet.
